# ALICE (Artificial Linguistics Intelligent Compute Engine)

ALICE is an ambitious project aimed at creating a comprehensive home and life assistant to manage mundane tasks through voice commands and automation. Integrating with smart home devices, offering personal assistant functionalities, and providing cross-platform support, ALICE seeks to streamline daily routines and enhance user interaction through advanced AI technologies.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Understands and processes voice commands in natural language.
- **Smart Home Integration**: Controls lighting, temperature, and other smart devices.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Accessible via web, mobile (iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS).
- **Personal Assistant Capabilities**: Manages calendars, reminders, and schedules.
- **Information Retrieval**: Answers questions, provides news updates, and performs web searches.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
